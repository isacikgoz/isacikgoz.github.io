      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the late 80s where software is mostly done by ad-hoc methodologies. The lack of a uniform framework for managing and engineering for software development forced JTC1 to initiate the 12207 standard. The standard has same concepts to introduce. A top level architecture of the life cycle of software that visualizes the beginning and the end of software life-cycle process. The life cycle present the relationships between processes. A modularity concept for the processes that they are low coupled and high cohesive. A responsibility concept for quality management of set of software parties. The processes are divided into three major classes which primary supporting and organizational. And each process is further designed in terms of its own constituent activities and set of tasks for this activities. A task is a set of actions and it takes inputs and gives outputs. It is expressed in the form of self, declaration, requirement, recommendation or permissible action.</p><p>There is also a evolution concept for process and their sub elements. Each process implements quality management principles. Thus, each process is responsible for performing its activities including activities. The standard also provides an improvement process for managing, controlling and improving the established processes and their performance. The standard is based upon the principles of general system engineering and a link between software. For example, the fabrication concept is evaluated coding with this approach. And it also provides the minimum system context for software. With this vision of the standard. An organization or party is reponsible for actions in the processes. With this approach there are two applicability concepts to projects and organizations.</p><p>The ISO/IEC 12207 standard has a response to the rapidly evolving software engineering discipline. Therefore the activities and tasks are what to do do items. With this feature the standard is future-proof. And adoptable by any other sectors. The ISO/IEC 12207 standard has a response to the rapidly evolving software engineering discipline. Therefore the activities and tasks are what to do do items. With this feature the standard is future-proof. And adoptable by any other sectors. The standard does not defines any certification criteria. The standard covers the full life-cycle of software system and caters to diverse. To apply this standard to an organization there are few prerequisites which trained personnel, familiarity with the organization‚Äôs policies, familiarity with the projects environment and clear understanding of the standard.</p><p>So, we have a running organization and we also have plenty of projects, let‚Äôs say we were not aware of the standard. What should we do? Well, there are no normative rules for applying and tailoring the standard. The standard guides a set of stops to application on a project but some helpful guidance, however, may be found in the ISO/IEC 12207 Guidebook or other literature. These are role in the life cycle, organizations‚Äô policies, system life cycle, development models, types of software, documentation, evaluations, project characteristics. The ISO/IEC 12207 standard has a general guidance an applying itself to an organization. It also has a relationship with ISO 9001 standard. These are at the process level, the ISO,IEC and JTC1 have been active in the standardization of quality assurance, process assessment, and life cycle processes. The former has been accomplishment at the system level; the latter two are being pursued at the software level. ISO/IEC 12207 provides the baselines of life cycle processes to the SPICE assessment process. It expected that as these standards evolve in the future, their mutual consistencies would improve.</p><p>To sum up this standard follows a well organized processes to implement quality in software development and management process. It takes its essence from other standards. With applying these processes into an organization or a project, the managing process would be easier. On the other hand there is a learning curve -which is a huge drawback- and tackling the resitance is challenging.</p>]]></content>

      <title>System Enginnering, assesment of the E-ST-10C</title>
      <link href="/2017/05/17/E-ST-10C/"/>
      <url>/2017/05/17/E-ST-10C/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-is-ECSS"><a href="#What-is-ECSS" class="headerlink" title="What is ECSS?"></a>What is ECSS?</h2><p>First of all, let‚Äôs start with ECSS. It is abbreviation of European Cooperation for Space Standardization. As the name explicitly yells, it is an organization for space standards. As 2017 they have 4 groups of standards and they are: engineering, management, product assurance, and sustainability.</p><h2 id="The-Standard"><a href="#The-Standard" class="headerlink" title="The Standard"></a>The Standard</h2><p>In this post I will focus on ECSS-E-ST-10C Space Engineering - System engineering general requirements document.<br>Before reading a formal/serious standard, it is a good to being aware of the purpose of any standard is to improve the overall quality of the effort. tl;dr: To save money. In fact, there is a nice quote from a guy -I couldn‚Äôt remember his name but I think he can probably be my instructor- ‚ÄúThe only valid measurement of the quality is money.‚Äù That means; quality is a indicator of what you buy for the money you gave. So, these standards aims to save labor-force, rework and other things so that large projects can fit those tight budgets. Also there is a risk factor, and I think reducing the risks is eventually converges to save money.</p><h2 id="Opinions"><a href="#Opinions" class="headerlink" title="Opinions"></a>Opinions</h2><p>I appreciate the effort for preparing these standards. They cover the domain with a structured way. The E-ST-10C defines system engineering function by it‚Äôs responsibilities, interactions and processes. I like the way they include space mission analysis into the system engineering. With this approach I think they build this document around the functionality rather than manageability . And this is, for me, a bold and splendid start.<br>There is also plenty od information about what is the elements of defined system engineering. As the nature of system engineering which is a complicated discipline, the E-ST-10C refers other ECSS standards. This makes the document a little challenging to read. To sum up, I think it is a good start to implement this system engineering approach to a space system project. It is a good fellow guide to carry in our pockets.</p>]]></content>

      <title>So, what about markdown?</title>
      <link href="/2017/04/22/markdown/"/>
      <url>/2017/04/22/markdown/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In my humble opinion markdown<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is one the handiest invention in the last decade. In the year 2017 it would be nonsense if I‚Äôd try to explain what is markdown. But, let‚Äôs say you are interested in software development and living in a cave or sleeping for years. You can google it and find plenty information about it.</p><p>In the last couple years I‚Äôve started to use markdown almost everyday. Not only for creating readme files also for handy notes and even serious documentation. I should clearly state that, this post is not a tutorial nor review. It is mostly about my experiences with integrating markdown to various aspects of my routines.</p><p>To start, let‚Äôs examine why markdown become one of my daily tools. The answer is: it is simple and it is robust. These simplicity and robustness fuse into each other and emerge  the most important major feature for a tool: being practical. This means I can use this tool for various needs and I won‚Äôt think too much while using it so that I can use it without hassle. What I am trying to lay emphasis on this tool is the nature of markdown makes it practical instead of fitting into the problem. My use of markdown concentrate on two things. First one is taking notes and the latter is writing serious documentation for my software projects.</p><h2 id="Note-taking"><a href="#Note-taking" class="headerlink" title="Note-taking"></a>Note-taking</h2><p>There are dozens of alternatives for note-taking and many of them can be used with markdown. I use an app called BoostNote and it brings me a lot of satisfaction. It is open source though.<br>In a nutshell; I write with markdown and the app provides an easy structure for packing them. I use git for synchronizing my notes between different environments. </p><p>The app looks like this:</p><p><img src="/images/boostnote.gif" alt="alt text" title="bossNote :)"></p><p>And the note structure is:<br><figure class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type: "MARKDOWN_NOTE"</span><br><span class="line">folder: "101ac7d93d740e45e74b"</span><br><span class="line">title: "Hi! This is my notebook! and I love it :)"</span><br><span class="line">content: "Hi! This is my notebook! and I love it :)"</span><br><span class="line">tags: [here I add my tags! üòé]</span><br><span class="line">isStarred: false</span><br><span class="line">createdAt: "2017-04-21T21:12:54.244Z"</span><br><span class="line">updatedAt: "2017-04-21T21:26:08.128Z"</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>As you can see, very simple. The content is written in markdown and there you go, you have an elegant note.</p><p>Also the folder structure is very simple too, manageable and convenient:</p><p><img src="/images/structure.gif" alt="alt text" title="the structure is clear as water"></p><p>Of course there is no single file for all notes :) This is a demo structure so there is only a single note file. But the good thing is you don‚Äôt have to manage  folders etc. they all managed by the app. I like this approach. I mean, the text files are easily recoverable if anything goes wrong.</p><p>Then I use git<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> for configuration management. If I had enough time and skill I would like to contribute BoostNote repository so that git feature can be embedded into the app. It would be cool if configuration management to be automatic like OneNote and EverNote.  Maybe in the future I can develop a plug-in for git integration if the BoostNote support plug-ins. I believe in the developers of the app, a plug-in feature would be splendid. For now I have to stage and commit by manually:</p><p><img src="/images/md_git.gif" alt="alt text" title="Initializing local git repository like a boss"></p><p>And there you go! My notes, synchronized, secure, versioned, backed up and so on!</p><p>It is simple as that!</p><h2 id="Serious-Documentation"><a href="#Serious-Documentation" class="headerlink" title="Serious Documentation"></a>Serious Documentation</h2><p>Yeah, the best part of my markdown experience. For instance, I am writing a serious blog post right now and this is my typical use case. What a coincidence!</p><p><img src="/images/caret.gif" alt="alt text" title="Caret is one the best markdown editors"></p><p>I use an app called ‚ÄúCaret‚Äù and it is great. Robust and well supported. I highly recommend it as a markdown editor.  There are many helper tools for creating a markdown document and this app includes few of them such as footnote support etc. It is actively developed and I am sure that developers will add a lot of cool features in the near future. I recommend you to buy this app.</p><p>And we are at the last paragraph, if you are reading this line that means either you just skipped to the end of this page or you had enough patience for my opinions ü§ì I want to thank anyone step.</p><div id="footnotes"><hr><div id="footnotelist"><ol style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"><li id="fn:1"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">1.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">Find more information in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></span><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"> ‚Ü©</a></li><li id="fn:2"><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; padding-right: 10px;">2.</span><span style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">Another cave issue, visit doctor first.
