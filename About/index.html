    <p>Something about me, I wonâ€™t give too many details but I like to keep a timeline of my life, a.k.a the breakpoints that had great impact to me. The things make me today. Mostly, it becomes easy to see these events in a structural sequence. Even I canâ€™t track what the fuck happened in my life. </p>
<section class="timeline"><ul><li><div><time>1986</time> A baby was born as a second son of a young couple.</div></li><li><div><time>1992</time> A child started to primary school. The beginning of the studentship journey. I donâ€™t remember anything about those years but I thought it is worth to mention ðŸ¤“</div></li><li><div><time>1993</time> A child went to U.S.A. for a couple years. That made a great impact for my life. I struggled for adapting in a foreign country also in my home country when I come back.</div></li><li><div><time>2000</time> A child started amateur programming with pair of visual basic books. I really enjoyed coding those days. Mostly it was replicating the tutorials in the book though. Still it was really fun and experimenting new codes was joyful even you donâ€™t know what are you doing.</div></li><li><div><time>2010</time> A man graduated from college. Unfortunately my department does not correlate too much with my software engineering profession but I have to say that I had a great computer science lecturer. He made me remember my joyful moments that I had in my childhood.</div></li><li><div><time>2011</time> A man started to work. I donâ€™t want to mention details here. Detailed information can be found on my LinkedIn page.</div></li><li><div><time>2013</time> A man got married. I have a beautiful wife and I love my entire family. I consider myself one of the luckiest person in the world for being a son, a husband and a brother. </div></li><li><div><time>2017</time> A man wrote this nonsense blog, yet, I find this entertaining (for myself ðŸ˜‚)</div></li></ul></section>
